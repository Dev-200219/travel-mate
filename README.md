# TravelMate

It is a personal project built using ReactJS and Redux powered by the Google Maps API and TripAdvisor API. A tool for your future travel experiences which allows you to know about your destination's famous restaurant's, hotel's and attractions and their various details to choose the best among them. It also provides you with a autocomplete location search bar and a Google Map showing all the famous location's cards on the map. You can also click on the map card to see the details of the respective place. 

# And the best of all it is completely responsive!!!!
